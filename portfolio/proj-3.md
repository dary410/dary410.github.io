title: Assimilation
---
As a first generation Taiwanese American immigrant, I understand the process of assimilation that an immigrant has to go through. This process, as revealed in a series of photos, has a universal pattern that begins with avoiding and antagonizing against the mainstream culture to the final embracing. This pattern exhibits in immigrants of all ages and background.
