<p>The San Mateo-Foster City School District sought to modernize and build new buildings for their then 26 year-old Foster City Elementary School. The majority of the work was to repair the mold caused by water leaking from the roofs. The new educational plan also called for an enlarged administration, library, and large group instruction gym space. For new buildings, the site layout aimed to create a private shared courtyard between buildings. The concept for the buildings is to match the architectural language of the existing buildings, while adding a hint of modernity through the use of innovative materials and structural system.</p>
