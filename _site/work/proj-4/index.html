<p>In an effort to increase product adoption at the end-user level, I designed a series of user focused microsite to showcase top use cases for the kiteworks end users. The concept behind the mockup design is limit the amount of clicks and scrolling to cover useful information including top uses, tutorials videos, FAQ, and links sections.</p>
