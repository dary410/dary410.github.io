  <p>The City of Kaohsiung is an important southern port city of Taiwan. Bound by the sea and the original irrigation canals built in the Qing Dynasty, the city thrives on water elements. A railroad line divides the Zuoying District into regions of a traditional West side and a trendy East side. Responding to the Kaohsiung redevelopment goal, a system of canal netportfolio can effectively link the two disconnected sides by providing transpirational, recreational, and storm drainage benefits.</p>
